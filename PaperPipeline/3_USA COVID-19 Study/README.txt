Name

3. USA COVID-19 Study


Description

The folder '3. USA COVID-19 Study' is mainly for downloading virus data of USA SARS-CoV-2 according to their NCBI accessions, including 
CDS sequences, genomic sequences. Those data are later processed into Ready-to-go data (RTG_Data), and the RTG_Data is later used in 
evalution of HIP. 



Script files:

1_COVID19_US_Download.ipynb

	This code file is for downloading data from NCBI website and process the downloaded sequence data into RSCU dataset, and CDS_Length dataset, 
    which are used into prediction with trained models. Besides, the Taxonomy dataset is generated by repeating from SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. 
    RSCU dataset, CDS_Length dataset, and Taxonomy dataset are organised into Ready-to-go data (RTG_Data).

    Contents:

        1. Download COVID-19 US data with NCBI Accession - And calculate codon biases
        2. Download Genome Length (required for CDS_Length dataset)
        3. Organise into 'RTG_Data'


2_Pred_Proba.ipynb

    This code file is for calculating HIP with trainied models and RTG_Data from '1_COVID19_US_Download.ipynb'.

    Contents:

        1. Pred_Proba for human Host
        2. Pred_Proba for all the Host
